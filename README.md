### Data Storage

- Data is stored locally using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API
- Automatic cleanup removes data older than 90 days
- Data persists across browser sessions

### Deduplication Logic

- Uses `slipId` as the unique identifier
- When recording data, if a slip ID already exists, the new data overwrites the old data
- This ensures that updated bet statuses (e.g., open ‚Üí won/lost) are properly tracked

### CSGOEmpire Compatibility

The extension is specifically designed for CSGOEmpire and works with their betting history page structure:
- Tables with rows having class `tr.bg-dark-3`
- Betting amounts in elements with `data-testid="currency-value"`
- Status in elements with class `h4.capitalize`
- Game names in elements with class `h4.text-light-1`
- CSGOEmpire's specific date format parsing
- Slip ID extraction from CSGOEmpire's table structure

**Note**: This extension is not compatible with other betting sites and is specifically tailored for CSGOEmpire's HTML structure and data format.

## Testing

### Test Page

The extension includes a `test-page.html` file for testing and development:

1. **Open `test-page.html`** in your browser
2. **Install the extension** if not already installed
3. **Click the extension icon** and then click "Record"
4. **Verify data is recorded** by checking the popup or full dashboard
5. **Expected results**: 4 records should be recorded (open bets are ignored)

The test page simulates CSGOEmpire's HTML structure with sample betting data, allowing you to test the extension without accessing the actual CSGOEmpire site.

## Customization

### Modifying Selectors for CSGOEmpire Updates

If CSGOEmpire updates their HTML structure, you may need to modify the selectors in `content.js`:

```javascript
// Current CSGOEmpire selectors (lines 18-24)
const betElems = row.querySelectorAll('[data-testid="currency-value"]');
const statusElem = row.querySelector("h4.capitalize");
const game = row.querySelector("h4.text-light-1")?.innerText.trim() || "";
const slipId = row.querySelector("td:nth-child(2) p, p.size-medium")?.innerText.trim() || "";
```

**Note**: These selectors are specifically designed for CSGOEmpire's current HTML structure. If CSGOEmpire updates their site design, these selectors may need to be updated accordingly.

### Adding New Status Types

To include additional bet statuses, modify the status filter in `content.js` (line 25):

```javascript
// Current filter
if (!['won', 'lost', 'cancelled'].includes(status)) {
  return;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check if you're on CSGOEmpire**: The extension only works on CSGOEmpire's betting history page
2. **Verify you're on the betting history page**: Make sure you're viewing your betting history, not other pages
3. **Check extension is enabled**: Check the extensions page to ensure it's enabled
4. **Check console for errors**: Open browser dev tools and look for error messages
5. **Try refreshing the page**: Sometimes the content script needs a page refresh to load properly
6. **Test with the test page**: Open `test-page.html` to verify the extension is working correctly

### Data Not Recording

1. **Check if you're on the correct page**: Make sure you're on CSGOEmpire's betting history page, not other sections
2. **Verify the "Record" button works**: Click the extension icon and try the "Record" button in the popup
3. **Check for JavaScript errors**: Look in the console for any parsing errors
4. **Ensure you have betting history**: The extension only works if you have betting history to display
5. **Test with the test page**: Open `test-page.html` to verify recording functionality

### Data Export Issues

1. **Ensure data exists**: The export button only works when there's data to export
2. **Check browser permissions**: Some browsers may block downloads
3. **Try a different browser**: If issues persist, try Chrome or Edge

## Development

### Making Changes

1. **Edit the relevant files** (content.js, popup.js, etc.)
2. **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Test on the target website**

### Debugging

1. **Content Script**: Use browser dev tools on the target page
2. **Popup**: Right-click the extension icon and select "Inspect popup"
3. **Background Script**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find the extension, and click "Inspect views: background page"
