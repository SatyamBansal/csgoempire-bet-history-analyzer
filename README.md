## Technical Details

### File Structure

```
betCalculator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json          # Extension manifest
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js            # Content script (injected into pages)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.html            # Extension popup UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ popup.js              # Popup functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background.js         # Background service worker
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

### Data Storage

- Data is stored locally using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API
- Automatic cleanup removes data older than 90 days
- Data persists across browser sessions

### Deduplication Logic

- Uses `slipId` as the unique identifier
- When recording data, if a slip ID already exists, the new data overwrites the old data
- This ensures that updated bet statuses (e.g., open ‚Üí won/lost) are properly tracked

### CSGOEmpire Compatibility

The extension is specifically designed for CSGOEmpire and works with their betting history page structure:
- Tables with rows having class `tr.bg-dark-3`
- Betting amounts in elements with `data-testid="currency-value"`
- Status in elements with class `h4.capitalize`
- Game names in elements with class `h4.text-light-1`
- CSGOEmpire's specific date format parsing
- Slip ID extraction from CSGOEmpire's table structure

**Note**: This extension is not compatible with other betting sites and is specifically tailored for CSGOEmpire's HTML structure and data format.

## Customization

### Modifying Selectors for CSGOEmpire Updates

If CSGOEmpire updates their HTML structure, you may need to modify the selectors in `content.js`:

```javascript
// Current CSGOEmpire selectors (lines 18-24)
const betElems = row.querySelectorAll('[data-testid="currency-value"]');
const statusElem = row.querySelector("h4.capitalize");
const game = row.querySelector("h4.text-light-1")?.innerText.trim() || "";
const slipId = row.querySelector("td:nth-child(2) p, p.size-medium")?.innerText.trim() || "";
```

**Note**: These selectors are specifically designed for CSGOEmpire's current HTML structure. If CSGOEmpire updates their site design, these selectors may need to be updated accordingly.

### Adding New Status Types

To include additional bet statuses, modify the status filter in `content.js` (line 25):

```javascript
// Current filter
if (!['won', 'lost', 'cancelled'].includes(status)) {
  return;
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check if you're on CSGOEmpire**: The extension only works on CSGOEmpire's betting history page
2. **Verify you're on the betting history page**: Make sure you're viewing your betting history, not other pages
3. **Check extension is enabled**: Check the extensions page to ensure it's enabled
4. **Check console for errors**: Open browser dev tools and look for error messages
5. **Try refreshing the page**: Sometimes the content script needs a page refresh to load properly

### Data Not Recording

1. **Check if "Record Bets" button appears**: If not, you might not be on CSGOEmpire's betting history page
2. **Verify you're on the correct page**: Make sure you're on CSGOEmpire's betting history page, not other sections
3. **Check for JavaScript errors**: Look in the console for any parsing errors
4. **Ensure you have betting history**: The extension only works if you have betting history to display

### Data Export Issues

1. **Ensure data exists**: The export button only works when there's data to export
2. **Check browser permissions**: Some browsers may block downloads
3. **Try a different browser**: If issues persist, try Chrome or Edge

## Development

### Making Changes

1. **Edit the relevant files** (content.js, popup.js, etc.)
2. **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Test on the target website**

### Debugging

1. **Content Script**: Use browser dev tools on the target page
2. **Popup**: Right-click the extension icon and select "Inspect popup"
3. **Background Script**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find the extension, and click "Inspect views: background page"
